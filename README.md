# ICURotationApp
A web application created during the COVID-19 pandemic to create a digital rotation that includes all facilities in the state of MS w/ICU capabilities.
There are comments within the code that provide a more detailed explanation of the programs' purpose and how that purpose is served.  I encourage 
downloading the project and opening it in Visual Studio to utilize it within a web browser.  It is a small ASP.NET Core program that is easy and convenient to use.
The MVC architecture pattern was utilized to build the program, and EntityFramework Core and LINQ was used for all data management and manipulation.
