# ICURotationApp
A web application created during the COVID-19 pandemic to create a digital rotation that includes all facilities in the state of MS w/ICU capabilities.
There are comments within the code that provide a more detailed explanation of the programs' purpose and how that purpose is served.  I encourage 
downloading the project and opening it in Visual Studio to utilize it within a web browser.  It is a small program that is easy and convenient to use.
It is a ASP.NET Core program built using the MVC structure.  EntityFrameworkCore and LINQ were used for all data management and manipulation within the 
code.
